# ETH Watchtower 🛡️

**Real-time Scam Contract Detection on EVM Chains.**

ETH Watchtower provides a live data stream to find and flag weird and scammy contracts in real-time, protecting the ecosystem from malicious actors.

## ✨ Features

- **Real-time Data Stream:** Our system continuously monitors EVM chains for suspicious contract deployments and interactions, providing you with up-to-the-second threat intelligence.
- **Full Details Available:** Get full details about the contract including source code or ABI, as well as categorized alerts.
- **Save Events for Later:** Easily save and bookmark events for later comparison, spot serial deployers and contract factories as well as rugpulls directly.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1.  **Mempool & Blockchain Scanning:** Our distributed network of nodes connects directly to EVM-compatible chains, scanning the mempool for pending transactions and analyzing newly mined blocks in real-time.
2.  **Bytecode & Heuristic Analysis:** Each new contract's bytecode is analyzed against a vast library of known scam patterns, vulnerabilities, and malicious functions.
3.  **AI-Powered Threat Modeling:** We leverage a proprietary machine learning model to identify novel threats and sophisticated scams by recognizing subtle patterns.
4.  **Real-time Scoring & Alerting:** Contracts are assigned a dynamic risk score. High-risk events are immediately flagged and pushed to our data stream.
